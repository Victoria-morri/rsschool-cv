### S U M M A R Y
Hello. Let's get acquainted. My name is Victoria and I am mastering a new profession of front-end developer. Here I will briefly introduce myself.
I started my career as a schoolgirl, I didn't want to depend on my parents. While getting higher education, I also continued to work and even went to the United States on a work and travel program, where I was able to improve my English. When I returned, I continued my work in sales, fulfilled plans, found many new clients (I was the best on this point), and received an offer with a promotion to the position of an administrator (personnel management, execution of plans, etc.).
Having a good job, I decided to develop further and began to build low-rise buildings in private sectors for the purpose of resale, which made it possible to improve my financial capabilities and completely switch to construction. And why IT? ...
Even at school she loved mathematics, the knowledge of which helped in the construction of houses. And now I can afford to do what I like.
From the above, it is not difficult to guess that I am a strong-willed person and love self-development.
